     * Asynchronously establishes a WebSocket Streaming @ref connection by making an
     * HTTP/WebSocket request to a remote @ref server. The application calls async_connect() with
     * a WebSocket URL. When the WebSocket connection is established, or an error occurs, the
     * completion function passed to async_connect() is called with the corresponding error code
     * and, if successful, a constructed @ref connection object.
     *
     * Connections can be unencrypted (`ws://` URLs) or encrypted with TLS (`wss://` URLs). To use
     * TLS, call enable_tls() to configure the certificate files to use before calling
     * async_connect(), or enable_tls_without_verification() to encrypt the connection without
     * authenticating the server.
     *
     * A client object can handle multiple async_connect() calls, but only one connection attempt
     * at a time may be in progress. Connection attempts can be canceled by calling cancel(); the
     * completion handler will then be called with the error code
     * boost::asio::error::operation_aborted.
