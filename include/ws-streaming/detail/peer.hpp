    /**
     * Implements the transport layer of a WebSocket Streaming Protocol connection to a remote
     * peer. Transport connections are symmetric, and support asynchronous, bidirectional exchange
     * of WebSocket Streaming Protocol packets. To send packets, callers use the send_data() and
     * send_metadata() functions. To receive packets, callers connect to the on_data_received and
     * on_metadata_received signals. The on_closed signal can be used to detect when the
     * connection has been closed, either gracefully or due to an error.
     *
     * Peer objects are constructed with, and take ownership of, a connected Boost.Asio socket,
     * and must always be managed by a std::shared_ptr, following the normal Boost.Asio pattern.
     * When run() is called, the peer object performs asynchronous I/O operations using the
     * execution context of the provided socket. This execution context must provide sequential
     * execution, i.e. in the terminology of Boost.Asio, it must be an explicit or implicit
     * strand. In addition, the caller must ensure no member functions are called concurrently
     * with each other or with an asynchronous completion handler. More explicitly stated, this
     * class is not thread-safe.
     *
     * Because peer objects must always be managed by a std::shared_ptr, a caller cannot directly
     * destroy a peer object. Calling the stop() function begins the process of destroying a peer:
     * all pending asynchronous I/O operations are canceled, and the on_closed signal is raised.
     * The peer is then destroyed when the caller releases all shared-pointer references to it and
     * once all asynchronous completion handlers have been called.
     *
     * @todo When acting as a client, outgoing WebSocket frames are not masked, in violation of
     *     section 5.3 of RFC 6455. This will not be compatible with third-party servers that
     *     enforce the masking requirement. Masking has a significant performance cost, in that it
     *     makes zero-copy impossible. Ideally, we should mask by default, but also negotiate with
     *     the server to disable masking if the server allows it.
     *
     * @todo This class is coupled with boost::asio::tcp and cannot currently be used with other
     *     stream socket types such as UNIX domain sockets. It should either be templated or use a
     *     polymorphic socket adapter so it can work with any stream socket type.

             * @param rx_buffer_size The maximum size of the receive buffer. The buffer starts out
             *     small and grows on demand up to this size, so the value sets an upper bound on
             *     the size of frames the peer can receive: larger frames will result in an error
             *     and cause the connection to be closed. Memory is only committed as incoming
             *     traffic actually requires it, which matters when many connections are open at
             *     once. Once grown, the buffer is not shrunk again for the lifetime of the peer.
             *     The specified value does not include the operating system's internal receive
             *     buffer.
             * @param tx_buffer_size The desired size of the transmit buffer. The transmit buffer
             *     does not grow, so this value sets an upper bound on the size of frames the peer
             *     can transmit: larger frames will result in an error and cause the connection to
             *     be closed. For maximum performance, the implementation will place as much as
             *     possible of the requested size in the operating system's internal transmit
             *     buffer, because this minimizes the likelihood of needing to additionally buffer
             *     data in user-space. Increasing the operating system's configured maximum
             *     transmit buffer size can often significantly improve performance.
