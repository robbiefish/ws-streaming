     * Base class for a WebSocket Streaming Protocol connection to a remote peer.
     *
     * This is the surface that wss::connection talks to. Two concrete implementations exist:
     *   - wss::detail::peer      - a plaintext TCP transport.
     *   - wss::detail::peer_tls  - a TLS-encrypted transport built on boost::asio::ssl::stream.
     *
     * The framing logic is transport-agnostic and lives here: the entire receive path (WebSocket
     * frame decoding, streaming-protocol packet assembly, metadata decoding) and the connection
     * lifecycle (run(), stop(), close()) are implemented once in this base class. The concrete
     * classes supply only the transport primitives.
     * The transmit path (send_data(), send_metadata()) is deliberately left to the concrete
     * classes, because it is coupled to a transport-specific write strategy: the plaintext peer
     * performs zero-copy scatter-gather sends, whereas the TLS peer must materialize and serialize
     * each frame through the OpenSSL engine.
     *
     * The three signals below are owned here so that connection can connect to them without
     * knowing the concrete transport type.
     *
     * All member functions must be invoked from the socket's execution context, which must be an
     * explicit or implicit strand. This class is not thread-safe.
