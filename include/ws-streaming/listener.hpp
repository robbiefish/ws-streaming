     * Asynchronously listens for incoming socket connections, and notifies the caller by raising
     * a signal.
     *
     * Listener objects own a Boost.Asio socket, and must always be managed by a std::shared_ptr,
     * following the normal Boost.Asio pattern. When run() is called, the listener object performs
     * asynchronous I/O operations using the execution context passed to the constructor. This
     * execution context must provide sequential execution, i.e. in the terminology of Boost.Asio,
     * it must be an explicit or implicit strand. In addition, the caller must ensure no member
     * functions are called concurrently with each other or with an asynchronous completion
     * handler. More explicitly stated, this class is not thread-safe.
     *
     * Because listener objects must always be managed by a std::shared_ptr, a caller cannot
     * directly destroy a listener object. Calling the stop() function begins the process of
     * destroying a listener: all pending asynchronous I/O operations are canceled. The listener
     * is then destroyed when the caller releases all shared-pointer references to it and once all
     * asynchronous completion handlers have been called.
     *
     * @tparam Protocol A Boost.Asio protocol object which specifies the types of the socket and
     *     address objects to be used.
